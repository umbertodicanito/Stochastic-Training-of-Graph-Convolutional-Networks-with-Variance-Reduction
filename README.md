# Stochastic Training of Graph Convolutional Networks with Variance Reduction

## Abstract
In this project, we analyzed the performance and behavior of a GCN (Graph
Convolutional Network). All the project is based on the paper ’ Stochastic
Training of Graph Convolutional Networks with Variance Reduction’ (Jianfei Chen, Jun Zhu, Le Song)
